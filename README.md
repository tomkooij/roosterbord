# Roosterbord — Dev server

To run a local dev HTTP server for this static site, you need Node.js (which includes npm).

Quick steps:

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS recommended).
2. In the repo root, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000/view.html in your browser.

Notes:
- A simple dev server `live-server` is added as a dev dependency and a `dev` npm script is available.
- If you prefer a different dev server (e.g., `http-server`) tell me and I can update the scripts.
